# amazon-app
An interactive storefront that runs in the console using node.
##How It Works
###Bamazon Customer This program consists of three seperate, but related apps. The first, BamazonCustomer.js, allows a "customer" 
to place an order from the Bamazon store.
 A check is then performed on the store inventory and the customer is either alerted that their order cannot be completed, or they are shown the total amount 
 owed (but no credit card number is requested).
